This is the official repository of the Human Gender Classifier (Homogenus) used in the paper 

***Expressive Body Capture: 3D Hands, Face, and Body from a Single Image.***
	
Numerous methods have classified human gender using face images. In full-body images of a person, the face may be small or not visible.  Here we trained a classifier to analyze gender based on full-body images. The input to the classifier its a full-body human image and the 2D key points detected by OpenPose.  We use information about gender in our SMPLify-X code to select the appropriate 3D body model. Note that gender is non-binary â€” SMPLify-X has male, female, and neutral body models.  When the classifier is certain, we use the corresponding gendered model.  When it is uncertain, we use the neutral one. This codebase consists of the inference code.

## Installation
**Requirements**
- Python 3.7
- [TensorFlow 1.13.1](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip)
- [Configer](https://github.com/nghorbani/configer)

Tested with CUDA-10.0 and cuDNN-7.5 running on Ubuntu 18.04.

Install from this repository for the latest developments:


```bash
python3.7 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
git clone https://github.com/Hyrtsi/homogenus.git
pip install --upgrade pip
python3 setup.py install
```

## Download models

* Download pretrained homogenus weights from the [project website](https://smpl-x.is.tue.mpg.de), downloads page. 
Uncompress the weights in a folder, *e.g. by default homogenus/trained_models/tf* , and use the directory path in the following commands.

## Run Homogenus
After installation and obtaining the weights for the model, inside the virtual environment, 
you should be able to run the homogenus_infer command to get the help:

```bash
python3 -m homogenus.tf.homogenus_infer -h

usage: homogenus_infer.py [-h] [-tm TRAINED_MODEL_DIR] -ii IMAGES_INDIR -oi
                          OPENPOSE_INDIR [-io IMAGES_OUTDIR]
                          [-oo OPENPOSE_OUTDIR]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -tm TRAINED_MODEL_DIR, --trained_model_dir TRAINED_MODEL_DIR
                        The path to the directory holding homogenus trained
                        models in TF.
  -ii IMAGES_INDIR, --images_indir IMAGES_INDIR
                        Directory of the input images.
  -oi OPENPOSE_INDIR, --openpose_indir OPENPOSE_INDIR
                        Directory of openpose keypoints, e.g. json files.
  -io IMAGES_OUTDIR, --images_outdir IMAGES_OUTDIR
                        Directory to put predicted gender overlays. If not
                        given, wont produce any overlays.
  -oo OPENPOSE_OUTDIR, --openpose_outdir OPENPOSE_OUTDIR
                        Directory to put the openpose gendered keypoints. If
                        not given, it will augment the original openpose json
                        files.

```
As an example, inside the homogenus folder you can run the following to get the gender predictions for the sample images and their corresponding openpose keypoints.
This command will print the predictions as well as creating new gendered openpose keypoints and gender overlayed images.  

```bash
python3 test.py -tm homogenus/trained_models/tf -ii ./samples/images/ -oi ./samples/openpose_keypoints/ -io out/img -oo out/pose
```

The headline image of this repository shows all these samples from the [LSP](http://dx.doi.org/10.5244/C.24.12) in-the-wild image dataset with overlayed genders for the [OpenPose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose) detected full-body humans.
